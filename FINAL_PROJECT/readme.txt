Project Title
Airline Satisfaction Analysis and Emotion Detector
Overview
Welcome ! This project focuses on analyzing customer satisfaction using a dataset from an airline. We employ various machine learning models to gain insights into factors influencing satisfaction levels. Additionally, we have implemented an emotion detector to further understand the emotional aspect of customer feedback.

Features
Satisfaction Analysis: Explore the dataset to understand patterns and trends related to customer satisfaction.
Machine Learning Models: Utilize different machine learning models to predict and analyze satisfaction scores.
Emotion Detector: Implement a tool to detect and analyze emotions expressed in customer feedback.
