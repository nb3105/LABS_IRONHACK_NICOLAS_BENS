# Lab | Comparing regression models


For this lab, you'll be using the same dataset you used in the previous customer analysis case study labs. We recommend using the same notebook since you will be reusing the same variables you previously created and used in labs. 

### Instructions

1. Fit the models  `LinearRegression`, `Lasso` and `Ridge` and compare the model performances. 
2. Define a function that takes a list of models and trains (and tests) them so we can try a lot of them without repeating code.
3. Use feature selection techniques (P-Value, RFE) to select a subset of features to train the model with.
4. (optional) Refit the models with the selected features.
